	<p>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.<br><br><img src="2kgame.PNG"width="300"height="200"><br><br> However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).<br><br><br>

Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. <br><br><img src="joystick.PNG"width="400"height="200"align="right"><br><br>The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.</p><br><br>

<p>
	PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garena_Free_Fire#:~:text=From%20Wikipedia%2C%20the%20free%20encyclopedia%20Garena%20Free%20Fire,and%20published%20by%20Garena%20for%20Android%20and%20iOS."target="_blank">2.FREEFIRE:</a></h3>
<p>The game consists of up to 50 players falling from a parachute on an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position, take weapons and supplies to extend battle life.

When the player joins a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the play island. While the plane is flying over the island the player can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the player must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the player is to survive on an island with a maximum of 50-51 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the player encounters along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.</p>
